## Description of solution

### Source of solution
Because the two wheeled inverted pendulum (TWIP) is a standard control problem and has been solved previously, I consulted existing solutions to implement the self- balancing for the robot.

The specific solution is borrowed from the undergraduate thesis of Ashish Katariya. (hereafter referred to as Katariya et al (2010)). The document is available [online] (https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/33465?show=full) and also included in the repository under 'docs'
