# TeeterBot 
TeeterBot is a self-balancing robot simulation model for ROS / Gazebo. The dimensions and mass of each component are easily configured using launch file arguments, so it is easy to adjust physical parameters to test robustness of control algorithms.

# Teeterbot self-balancing
This repository is modified from the original teeterbot repository to implement a sel-balancing controller. For more details, see the links below

# Example cases and visualization
Please note that the robot is purposely made to lose balance by driving it at high velocities or suddenly changing velocities -- this causes large deviations from the linear approximation and leads to loss of balance
